# Algorithms

Algorithms help solving problems efficiently and therefore common and proven algorithms are important to know.

Many such algorithms can be applied to strings, arrays or collections, to sort, search or mutate.

### Pancake Sort

Implement pancake sort. All elements of the array are greater than zero.

```kotlin
fun IntArray.pancakeSort()
```

Implement a helper function that flips the first `n` elements.
Pancake sort must use this function.

```kotlin
fun IntArray.flipN(n: Int)
```

The algorithms must work in place and in `O(1)` space complexity.
