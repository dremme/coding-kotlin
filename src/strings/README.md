# Strings

Strings are also very commonly asked in coding interviews. They are often implemented as array of characters, so the questions are very similar.

Parsing and regular expressions questions are very popular as well.

As with arrays algorithms are often required to have `O(n)` or even `O(1)` time complexity.

### Converting strings

Convert a string of numeric characters into an integer (unsigned), without using and libraries or parsing functions.

```kotlin
fun convertToInt(text: String): Int
```
